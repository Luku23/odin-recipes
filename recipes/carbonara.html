    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Carbonara is a beloved Italian pasta dish known for its rich, creamy texture and savory depth. 
        The pasta, typically spaghetti or rigatoni, is coated in a luxurious sauce made from eggs and Pecorino
        Romano cheese, giving it a silky, golden appearance. Scattered throughout are crispy, caramelized pieces 
        of guanciale or pancetta, adding a smoky, salty crunch to each bite. The dish is finished with a generous sprinkle 
        of freshly ground black pepper, which enhances the flavors with its subtle heat. The final presentation is simple 
        yet elegant, with the pasta glistening in its creamy coating, inviting you to dive into its comforting warmth.
