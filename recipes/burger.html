    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An empty burger sits on a plain white plate, with no patty,
        condiments, or toppings in sight. The bun is lightly toasted, with a golden-brown exterior that 
        hints at warmth and crispiness. The top bun is slightly askew, revealing the untouched, fluffy
        interior of the bottom bun. The absence of any fillings emphasizes the simplicity of the bread, 
        with no drips of sauce or edges of lettuce peeking out. It’s a minimalist representation of what could 
        have been a hearty meal, leaving a sense of expectation and curiosity about what’s missing.
